# eCommerce Customer Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and reports for a data science project focused on analyzing an e-commerce transaction dataset. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a lookalike model, and performing customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate skills in data analysis, machine learning, and business insight generation. The project uses a dataset consisting of three CSV files: `Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, and `Transactions.csv`. The tasks include:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data, identifying patterns, and deriving business insights.
2.  **Lookalike Model:** Building a model to recommend similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
3.  **Customer Segmentation:** Using clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of three CSV files:

*   **`Customers.csv`:** Contains customer information such as unique ID, name, region, and signup date.
*   **`Products.csv`:** Contains product information such as unique ID, name, category, and price.
*   **`Transactions.csv`:** Contains transaction details such as unique ID, customer ID, product ID, transaction date, quantity, total value, and price.

The CSV files are located in the `data` directory.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```dir
├── data/
│ ├── Customers.csv
│ ├── Products.csv
│ └── Transactions.csv
├── Gaurav_Wankhede_EDA.ipynb
├── Gaurav_Wankhede_EDA.pdf
├── Gaurav_Wankhede_Lookalike.csv
├── Gaurav_Wankhede_Lookalike.ipynb
├── Gaurav_Wankhede_Clustering.pdf
├── Gaurav_Wankhede_Clustering.ipynb
└── README.md
```

*   **`data/`:** Contains the CSV datasets.
*   **`Gaurav_Wankhede_EDA.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
*   **`Gaurav_Wankhede_EDA.pdf`:** PDF report summarizing the business insights from EDA.
*   **`Gaurav_Wankhede_Lookalike.csv`:** CSV file containing lookalike recommendations.
*   **`Gaurav_Wankhede_Lookalike.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook explaining the lookalike model.
*   **`Gaurav_Wankhede_Clustering.pdf`:** PDF report summarizing the clustering results.
*   **`Gaurav_Wankhede_Clustering.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering code.
*   **`README.md`:** This file.

**Note:** Replace `Gaurav_Wankhede` with your actual first and last name.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaurav-Wankhede/Zeotap_Intern_Assignment
    cd Zeotap_Intern_Assignment
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
    *   Open `Gaurav_Wankhede_EDA.ipynb`, `Gaurav_Wankhede_Lookalike.ipynb`, and `Gaurav_Wankhede_Clustering.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    *   Run all cells in each notebook to execute the code and generate the outputs.

4.  **View the reports:**
    *   Open `Gaurav_Wankhede_EDA.pdf` and `Gaurav_Wankhede_Clustering.pdf` to view the business insights and clustering results.
    *   Open `Gaurav_Wankhede_Lookalike.csv` to view the lookalike recommendations.

## Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Thoroughness of the EDA and the quality of the insights derived.
*   **Business Insights:** Relevance and actionability of the business insights.
*   **Lookalike Model:** Model accuracy, logic, and quality of recommendations.
*   **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering logic, metrics, and visual representation of clusters.
*   **Code Quality:** Cleanliness, efficiency, and readability of the code.
*   **File Naming Convention:** Accuracy of file formats and naming conventions.
